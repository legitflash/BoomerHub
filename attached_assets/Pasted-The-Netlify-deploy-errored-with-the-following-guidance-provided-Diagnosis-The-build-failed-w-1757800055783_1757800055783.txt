The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with a type error in the file `src/app/blog/page.tsx` at line 171 due to incompatible types in the `searchParams` property.

**Solution:**
To fix this error, the user needs to ensure that the `searchParams` property in the file `src/app/blog/page.tsx` has the correct type that satisfies the constraint. The `searchParams` property should include the properties `then`, `catch`, `finally`, and other properties required by the `Promise` type. Verify that the type of `searchParams` includes all the necessary properties for a `Promise<any>` type.
