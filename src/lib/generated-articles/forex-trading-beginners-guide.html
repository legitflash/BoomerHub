    <p class="lead">The foreign exchange (Forex) market is the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars traded daily. While it may seem intimidating, getting started is more accessible than you think. This guide breaks down the process into five simple, actionable steps to help you begin your Forex trading journey confidently.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold font-headline">What is Forex Trading?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">In simple terms, Forex trading is the act of buying one currency while simultaneously selling another. Currencies are traded in pairs (like EUR/USD or GBP/JPY), and traders speculate on whether a currency's value will rise or fall against another. The goal is to profit from these fluctuations in exchange rates.</p>
