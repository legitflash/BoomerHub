    <p class="lead">The idea of making money online can seem abstract. To make it concrete, I embarked on a challenge: to earn $100 using only Get-Paid-To (GPT) apps, starting from zero. This wasn't about getting rich quick; it was about proving the concept. Hereâ€™s a transparent breakdown of how it went, the strategy I used, and what I learned along the way.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold font-headline">The Goal & The Toolkit</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">The objective was simple: earn $100 in withdrawable cash. To avoid spreading myself too thin, I focused on just three highly-rated platforms known for their variety and reliability.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Swagbucks:</strong> For its sheer variety of earning methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Prolific:</strong> For its high-paying, quality academic surveys.</li>
        <li><strong>Freecash:</strong> For its lucrative mobile game offers.</li>
    </ul>

                <p class="mb-4">Relying on one type of task is slow and inefficient. I diversified my efforts across three main categories to maximize my time.</p>

                        <li><strong>High-Effort, High-Reward (Game Offers):</strong> This was the powerhouse. I accepted an offer on Freecash to reach Level 40 in a city-builder game for a $50 reward. This took the most time but provided the biggest single chunk of earnings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium-Effort, Medium-Reward (Surveys):</strong> I dedicated time to Prolific, which paid an average of $8-$10 per hour. The surveys were engaging and paid fairly for my time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-Effort, Low-Reward (Passive/Easy Tasks):</strong> While watching TV or during downtime, I used Swagbucks to watch videos, click through web pages, and answer daily polls. This added up slowly but required almost no mental energy.</li>

                        <li><strong>Next 30-40 Minutes:</strong> Log into Prolific and complete any available surveys. If none were available, I'd switch to Swagbucks for their higher-paying surveys.</li>
                        <li><strong>Final 10 Minutes:</strong> End the session by playing the mobile game to progress towards the goal and run some passive video apps on Swagbucks.</li>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-headline mb-2">Key Takeaways from the Experiment</h3>
        <p>Making your first $100 with GPT sites is absolutely achievable. The most important lesson is that the highest-paying tasks (like game offers) are what move the needle the most. Use surveys and other micro-tasks to fill the gaps. It's a great way to build a small pot of "fun money" or seed capital for your first real investment.</p>
