        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <p>Let's get practical. Hereâ€™s a general roadmap to get you started:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Research and Learn:</strong> Dedicate time to learn the basics. Read blogs, watch tutorials, and consider taking a foundational course.</li>
          <li><strong>Set Up Your Tools:</strong> This could be opening a brokerage account, creating a social media business profile, or signing up for a no-code app builder.</li>
          <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't risk a large amount of capital or time initially. Start with a small project or investment to test the waters.</li>
          <li><strong>Analyze and Adapt:</strong> Review your results. What's working? What isn't? Adjust your strategy based on data, not emotion.</li>
          <li><strong>Scale Up:</strong> Once you have a proven strategy that yields positive results, you can begin to scale your efforts.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
        <p>Many beginners make similar mistakes. Being aware of them can save you time and money.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lack of Patience:</strong> Success rarely happens overnight. Be prepared for a journey of consistent effort.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring Risk Management:</strong> In any venture involving money, understanding and managing risk is paramount.</li>
          - <strong>Following Hype Blindly:</strong> What works for one person might not work for you. Do your own research before jumping on a trend.</li>
        </ul>
