          <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't risk a large amount of capital or time initially. Start with a small project or investment to test the waters.</li>
          <li><strong>Analyze and Adapt:</strong> Review your results. What's working? What isn't? Adjust your strategy based on data, not emotion.</li>
